# Flight GIS Project

This project is created with react.js and bootstrap.css
All the data is from APIs such as: Yelp, HERE, Amadeus...

## How it works?

Type the desired flight number, and you'll see everything you need near the origin and destination airports.
The weather, the closest businesses bus stations, and hotels.

### to make things easy! what to do before you get to your flight, and after you land :)
